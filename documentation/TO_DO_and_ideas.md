# Project Feature Ideas/ TO DO

## Essential

The below features will absolutely need to be implemented before deployment.

### Automated draft runner

Making the draft runner run autonomously after set up. Need to implement timers for rounds and picks.

### Import and Export for CSV

The current workflow for drafts involves filling and reading Google Sheets with computer vision. The draft manager aims to fill the gap of manual work in between and thus needs to be integrated to work with the sheets. Need to implement an import and export function with the current established format.

### Addition of Unranked players

Not all players are ranked with an ISS number and the number of them is quite large. Only a small portion of them are relevant though. So a way for users to add unranked players to the database should be available. Current idea is that there's a shared subset of unranked players available to be added to your own list. Each user can add players to this shared subset, which will be visible to everyone else too. Some way of trying to avoid duplicates should be included.

## Nice-to-Have

These features are not essential, but would improve the experience/usability of the app.

### Testing

Some basic level testing would be helpful, especially as the app gets more complicated. It is not absolutely necessary as failures aren't catastrophic in this hobby project in any way.

### Improve the UI

The current UI is lacking in interactiveness and clarity. Need to map out issues and fix them. Known issues are mostly feedback on actions and user draftlist UX as a whole.

### Discord integration

Discord integration for authentication would add security and ease of use for all parties. The leagues are run through discord servers, so it would also be great to have a bot to post to the discord server when draft is progressing.

### Picks by team

It would be nice to have a way for all users to check what picks each team has.

### Draft history

User-specific and league-specific draft history would be nice to include.
